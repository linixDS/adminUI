## Mailbox definitions
##

# Each mailbox is specified in a separate mailbox section. The section name
# specifies the mailbox name. If it has spaces, you can put the name
# "in quotes". These sections can contain the following mailbox settings:
#
# auto:
#   Indicates whether the mailbox with this name is automatically created
#   implicitly when it is first accessed. The user can also be automatically
#   subscribed to the mailbox after creation. The following values are
#   defined for this setting:
# 
#     no        - Never created automatically.
#     create    - Automatically created, but no automatic subscription.
#     subscribe - Automatically created and subscribed.
#  
# special_use:

# NOTE: Assumes "namespace inbox" has been defined in 10-mail.conf.
namespace inbox {
  # These mailboxes are widely used and could perhaps be created automatically:
  mailbox Drafts {
    special_use = \Drafts
    auto = subscribe
  }
  mailbox Junk {
    special_use = \Junk
  }
  mailbox Trash {
    special_use = \Trash
    auto = subscribe
  }

  # For \Sent mailboxes there are two widely used names. We'll mark both of
  # them as \Sent. User typically deletes one of them if duplicates are created.
  mailbox Sent {
    special_use = \Sent
    auto = subscribe
  }
  mailbox "Sent Messages" {
    special_use = \Sent
    auto = subscribe
  }

}
